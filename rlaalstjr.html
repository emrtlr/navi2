<strong>Komodo doesn't outshine as the best HTML editor</strong>,
 but it's great for for the price,<br> 
especially if you build in XML where it truly excels.<p> 
<u>I use Komodo Edit every day for my work in XML,</u> 
and I use it a lot for basic HTML editing as well. 
This is one editor I'd be lost without.
